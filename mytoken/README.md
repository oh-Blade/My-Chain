# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a contract generated by [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/), a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

这个项目演示了一个基本的Hardhat用例。它带有 [OpenZeppelin向导](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) 生成的合约，该合约的测试以及部署该合约的脚本。
